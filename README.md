vim-files
=====

These are my files for customising Vim. I use the Tomorrow-Night-Bright color scheme, but also like Herald and Desert Evening.

To use these files, copy the .vimrc file and the entire .vim directory to your home directory.

If you use Vim as I have it set up, it's able to identify several file types and perform indentation and syntax checking for them. I've customized the status line to show row, column, path to the file, the modification flag, the read-only flag, and the file type. Tab stops are set to two spaces, and tab characters are converted to spaces. Code folding is enabled in `.vimrc` with the top-most fold default to open. If you don't want code folding, delete `.vimrc` aand rename `.vimrc_no_folding` to `.vimrc`.
